}

//    Once all the info for a VehicleInfo has been entered and a VehicleInfo object has been created the
//      report(vehicleInfo) method in the TelematicsService should be called. This method should:
//
//    Write the VehicleInfo to a file as json using the VIN as the name of the file and a "json" extension
//      (e.g. "234235435.json"). The file will overwrite any existing files for the same VIN.

//    Find all the files that end with ".json" and convert back to a VehicleInfo object.

//    Update a dashboard.html (only show 1 place after the decimal for values that are doubles).
//      The dashboard.html should look something like this (with the '#' replaced with a number)
